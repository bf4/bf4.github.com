-------------------
Rails 4.1 escapes ' to &#39; as it is better supported than &#x27;
See
rails/rails@6b2a24c

ERB::Util.html_escape` encodes single quote as `#39`. Decimal form has
better support in old browsers.

&#39 dates back to SGML when &#x27 was introduced in HTML 4.0


-------------------
to_json gives us the correct time format for javascript date parsing

2014-04-24T18:03:58-05:00 # parseable
2014-06-16 16:41:59 -0500 # not parseable

Some JSON changes:

- Behavior of JSON.generate has change in a number of ways
- Remove j alias for ERB::Util#json_escape.
  The j alias is already used forActionView::Helpers::JavaScriptHelper#escape_javascript
  and both modules are included in the view context that would confuse the developers.
- Adds encode_big_decimal_as_string option to force JSON serialization
  of BigDecimal as numeric instead of wrapping them in strings for safety.
- Time helpers honor the application time zone when passed a date.


-------------------
JSON.generate(obj) fails under Rails4. Use to_json instead
JSON.generate(obj)
calls
JSON::SAFE_STATE_PROTOTYPE.generate(obj)

which in Rails 3 basically calls obj.to_json
whereas in Rails 4 we get
"only generation of JSON objects or arrays allowed"

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html

Deprecations

ActiveSupport::JSON::Variable is deprecated. Define your own #as_json
and #encode_json methods for custom JSON string literals.

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html

Removals

Removed MultiJSON dependency. As a result, ActiveSupport::JSON.decode no
longer accepts an options hash for MultiJSON.

Removed support for the encode_json hook used for encoding custom
objects into JSON. This feature has been extracted into the
activesupport-json_encoder gem. (Related

Removed deprecated ActiveSupport::JSON::Variable with no replacement

Deprecations

Deprecated the require path active_support/core_ext/object/to_json.
Require active_support/core_ext/object/json instead.

Deprecated ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding::CircularReferenceError. This
feature has been extracted into the activesupport-json_encoder gem.

Deprecated ActiveSupport.encode_big_decimal_as_string option. This
feature has been extracted into the activesupport-json_encoder gem.

Notable Changes

ActiveSupport's JSON encoder has been rewritten to take advantage of the
JSON gem rather than doing custom encoding in pure-Ruby.
More Details)

Improved compatibility with the JSON gem



-------------------
Rails4 updates the counter cache on association assignment [https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/13304](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/13304)

-------------------

Preserve old behavior of Object.try blowing up
Object#try will now return nil instead of raise a NoMethodError
 if the receiving object does not implement the method, but you can
 still get the old behavior by using the new Object#try!
 [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html#active-support-notable-changes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html#active-support-notable-changes)

Thus, in Rails 3, owner.try(:login) would raise an exception where in
 Rails 4 it would fail silently and return nil

Changed via
git grep 'try(' {app,config,lib,spec,engines}/**/*.rb | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u | xargs perl -pi -w -e "s/try\(:/try\!\(:/g;"
-------------------
Remove rails4 session compatibility gem
Rails.logger.warn "You're on Rails 4 so it's probably safe to remove
  the rails_4_session_flash_backport gem!"
https://github.com/envato/rails_4_session_flash_backport/blob/master/lib/rails_4_session_flash_backport.rb

ActionController::Request is now ActionDispatch::Request

MONKEYPATCH 4.1 to allow secrets.secret_token and blank secret_key_base

# NOTE: Rack::Request is wrapped in the controller by an ActionDispatch::Request
+# [https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal.rb#L246](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal.rb#L246)

+# which has the behavior of returning the original http method as 'method',
+# even when acting on the overridden method, as 'request_method'.
+# This has the effect of a request being routed to 'PUT' but logged as 'POST'
+# since the payload[:method] returns the original http method, per above.
+    # We have a lot of middleware before Rack::Runtime. Normally, Rack::MethodOverride is after
+    # Rack::Runtime, but we want to ensure the http methods are properly overridden for

-------------------
Replace all paginate(:all, *args) with paginate(*args)
in 2.3
https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/blob/2-3-stable/lib/will_paginate/finder.rb#L27

In short, paginating finders are equivalent to ActiveRecord finders; the
 only difference is that we start with "paginate" instead of "find" and
 that <tt>:page</tt> is required parameter:

   `@posts = Post.paginate :all, :page => params[:page], :order => 'created_at DESC'`

 In paginating finders, "all" is implicit. There is no sense in paginating
 a single record, right? So, you can drop the <tt>:all</tt> argument:
WillPaginate blows up on any option besides :page, :per_page, or :tot…
…al_entries

apply_finder_options(options) has been removed from Rails
and put in activerecord-deprecated_finders

We can avoid the bug by not passing any options to paginate

or, even better, note that #paginate(options)
is deprecated in favor of #page(num).per_page(num).limit etc.
see WillPaginate::ActiveResource::RelationMethods

mislav/will_paginate#322
mislav/will_paginate#326
https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/blob/ca7d45f955066f0a01d500769a8efbb6acc4032c/lib/will_paginate/active_record.rb#L154


-------------------
ActionController::UnknownAction is deprecated!
Use ::AbstractController::ActionNotFound instead. 
-------------------
Now need to headers.env.merge({}) instead of headers.merge({})
Error:
undefined method `each' for
"#<ActionDispatch::Http::Headers:0x0000010ddb96c0>":String

Code was calling headers.merge({})

Cause:
rails/rails@9af59b2#diff-e2459c004ff9c0786d100a7ceb4200a9R15

The semantics of headers.merge changed

Basically, now we want headers.env

See the linked commit
-------------------
Streaming has changed in Rails 3. Fixed streaming CSV downloads
Can no-longer render :text => Proc.new
Now, we set self.response_body = CsvStreamer.new and yield response_body

To reproduce:

1. Go to /participants/imports
2. Add a CSV, e.g.
Email (Required),First Name (Required),Last Name (Required),Password,Phone (US only),Responding As,Private Data
fake@matt.com,Fake,Diebolt,testing,456-540-3040,Tester,Fako
3. Click continue
4. On the Review or Import steps, click on the little bitty Excel logo
next to 'valid participantsa', 'warnings', 'errors', and confirm the
downloaded file looks like a CSV

todo: write a test
+  class CsvStreamer
+    def initialize
+      @output = ""
+      @csv = CSV.new(@output, :row_sep => "\r\n")
+    end
+    def <<(args)
+      @csv << args
+    end
+    def each(&block)
+      @output.each_line(&block)
+    end
+  end
self.response_body ||= CsvStreamer.new
+    yield response_body

-------------------
Rails4 does not infer the polymorphic type of fixtures
So, we specify the subject_type of each order fixture

Else, on boot of anything that requires spec_helper,
the spec with crash with

ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
Mysql2::Error: Field 'subject_type' doesn't have a default value:

Rails4 removed AR.verify_active_connections!
Supposedly it does this itself now
socialcast/resque-ensure-connected#3

-------------------
Convert the new Rails4 Mime::Nulltype to nil
 We call #to_sym.to_s on the request.format to get it's simple name,
 which is what we are comparing it with, below.
 Rails 4 introduces a Mime::NullType that isn't 'null-enough'
 to make it into the failure condtion.
 see [https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8085/files](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8085/files)
 This way, Mime::NullType will be converted to 'nil' by its
 own logic, we can continue on our way.
 For completeness, the js Mime::type object to_sym.to_is is 'js'

was:
    formats = [request.format]
now:
    formats = [request.format.to_sym.to_s]

-------------------
Ensure cookies compatibility with Rails3
Stay on the :marshal serializer till 4 is stable

Then we can switch to :hybrid, and eventually to :json
