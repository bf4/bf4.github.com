# SUMMARY:

*   Jack-of-all-trades that picks up what needs to be done, often without being asked.
*   Documents and details work done, share with team.  At Metromix I created developer setup docs used to bootstrap developers and release docs to stabilize the release process.
*   I'm most likely to say, "enough talk, let's do it."
