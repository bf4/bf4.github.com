[Our Solar System in Safari and Chrome (webkit browsers)](http://neography.com/experiment/circles/solarsystem/)

(In my FF3 it looks right, but doesn't animate).

[But IE has a slightly boxier rendering](http://feltron.tumblr.com/post/745831161/ie-rendering-of-a-handsome-css3-solar-system)... (confirmed with IE7 on my machine).

Web standards need to be a bit more standard... if we're to go to infinity and beyond.
