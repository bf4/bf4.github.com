> DP: What's the downside of paper?

DB: It doesn't capitalize on the tremendous power of computers, which have transformed the use of information in every other part of our lives, business and travel and leisure.

DP: Where do we stand relative to other countries?




> DB: Most other countries have much more use of electronic health records than we do.
