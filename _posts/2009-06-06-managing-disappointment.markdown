When given a disappointing situation, there is more than one way to think about it, and hence, more than one way to feel about it and react to it.  Rather than thinking about it negatively and feeling angry, I can, while still being disappointed, accept that I can't always get what I want or that people can't always live up to my expectations, embrace those limitations, and feel good about it.

Of course, that's easier said than done, but the trick is to recognize that moment in the situation when my thoughts may automatically think negative, and then stop and think of the positive or more-balanced thought, and embrace that.
