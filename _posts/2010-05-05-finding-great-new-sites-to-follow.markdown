I discovered today, much to my delight, that in [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com), when I'm reading a news feed of a blog I like, that when I click "Feed settings", then "More like this" and voila, you get a list of similar news feeds.

It's a great way to discover new sites! Very cool.

(It's also interesting to see which feeds are on the recommended list from multiple source feeds).
