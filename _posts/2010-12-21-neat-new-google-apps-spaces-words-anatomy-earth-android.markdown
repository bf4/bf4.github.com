Over the last couple of weeks, lots of apps have debuted on [Google Labs](http://www.googlelabs.com/), a laboratory where our more adventurous users can try our experimental products and offer feedback directly to the engineers who developed them. Teams at Google are gearing up to deliver more and more cool innovations to users, and this month alone, we’ve launched six new products on Google Labs. Here are the highlights of our recent releases.

[App Inventor for Android](http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/)

[Body Browser](http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/) is a demo app that allows you to visualize complex 3D graphics of the human body. It works in the latest beta version of [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/) and uses WebGL, a new standard that enables 3D experiences in the web browser without any plug-ins.

[DataWiki](http://datawiki.googlelabs.com/) is a wiki for structured data, extending the idea of a normal [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) to make it easy to create, edit, share and visualize structured data, and to interlink data formats to make them more understandable and useful.

[Google Books Ngram Viewer](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/) graphs and compares the historical usage of phrases based on the datasets comprised of more than 500 billion words and their associated volumes over time in about 5.2 million books.

[Google Earth Engine](http://earthengine.googlelabs.com/)

[Google Shared Spaces](http://sharedspaces.googlelabs.com/) is an easy way for you to share mini-collaborative applications, like scheduling tools or games, with your friends or colleagues.... This product is built on some of the [technology used in Google Wave](http://googlewave.blogspot.com/2010/12/announcing-google-shared-spaces.html).

You can find more Labs products on [googlelabs.com](http://googlelabs.com/). Please play with them and give us feedback. And stay tuned for experiments coming in the future.
