> Then we gave the children the blocks and asked them to light up the machine. These children, who couldnâ€™t yet add or subtract, were more likely to put the high-probability yellow block, rather than the blue one, on the machine.


Notice that the children are more likely to use the yellow block. I wonder how powerful the effect is and if it varies much from baby to baby or at different ages or gestational lengths.


> Babies are captivated by the most unexpected events. Adults, on the other hand, focus on the outcomes that are the most relevant to their goals. In a well-known experiment, adults saw a video of several people tossing a ball to one another. The experimenter told them to count how many passes particular people made. In the midst of this, a person in a gorilla suit walked slowly through the middle of the video. A surprising number of adults, intent on counting, didn't even seem to notice the unexpected gorilla.

...

Computer scientists talk about the difference between exploring and exploiting-- a system will learn more if it explores many possibilities, but it will be more effective if it simply acts on the most likely one. Babies explore; adults exploit.


Interesting in how these generalities play out to different extents in adults as to how goal-oriented they are, being explorative or exploitative.
