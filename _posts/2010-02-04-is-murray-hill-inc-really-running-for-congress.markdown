[Corporation Says It Will Run for Congress - Economix Blog - NYTimes.com](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/corporation-says-it-will-run-for-congress/).

Clever challenging of the recent [SCOTUS decision](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html) that confers some rights of citizens upon corporations.  The ad, itself, I don't find very clever, but the concept, definitely.

It's too obviously satirical, and yet [Murray Hill Inc.](http://www.murrayhillweb.com/new_day/index.html) actually set up a paypal "support" link with the text "Murray Hill Inc. video program. This is NOT a federal campaign account or a tax-exempt donation.".  So, they *will* accept money, but admit it's *not* a campaign. Odd.

Links:  Murray Hill Inc. is launching the campaign with a [website](http://www.murrayhillweb.com/new_day/index.html), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Murray-Hill-Inc-for-Congress/314963396608?ref=search&sid=1142349892.780307729..1) page and [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/user/murrayhillcongress), [products](http://www.cafepress.com/MHIncCongress).
