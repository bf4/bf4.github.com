> The program had two goals: aiding the ailing car industry and improving fuel economy of the vehicles on the road.

Cars submitted under the program were to be junked. They had to be less than 25 years old and have a fuel economy, as rated by the window sticker, of 18 miles a gallon or less.

The size of the rebate depended on the fuel economy of the replacement vehicle. Consumers were also supposed to receive the scrap value of their trade-ins.

From the dealers’ point of view, the program was a resounding success.

“Two hundred and fifty thousand vehicles in four weeks?” Mr. Wood said. “One word comes out of my mouth: Wow.”

Seems like this plan was a good idea and successful.  The article is about it running out of money and how the White House intends to continue it anyways.
