NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The Obama administration on Thursday unveiled a proposed new framework for protecting consumers' privacy online.

The plan centers around a "Privacy Bill of Rights" that would encourage better transparency about data collection online, according to the Commerce Department's report on its policy recommendations. It would promote "informed consent" for consumers through simple notices that clearly state what personal information will be collected and what will be done with it.


The Commerce Department's proposal would be voluntary -- companies would be able to choose whether or not they want to participate. But for those that do, their commitment would be enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission.

Certainly there is a need for us all to better understand what data about us is available, how it is collected, how we provide it, and how we can protect it.  All it takes is a look at all the personal information people post on blogs and Facebook to see how little foresight most of us have about what can be found about us.  Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.
