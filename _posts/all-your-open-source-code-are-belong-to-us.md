## TL;DR Own your OSS Code

### Using OSS Code

* Create an issue
 * Good bug report: why doesn't work
 * New feature
 * No / Wrong / Hard to understand documentation
* Update wiki
* [Fork and submit PR](http://www.element84.com/github-pull-requests-made-easy.html)
 * Benefits:
   - Get feedback
   - Read code
   - meet ppl
   - feel good
   - learn

Don't blog without adding an issue. Be nice to community

### Maintaining OSS Code

* Attend issues, PR's
* Ask for help / maintainer
* Label issues. Provide a 'jump in'
* Rejecting issues: be nice, 'nope'
* Publish updates / releases
* Document what it's for, how it's used
* Document how to contribute
* [Still Maintained badge](http://stillmaintained.com)
* [Semantic Versioning: Major / Minor / Patch](http://semver.org), Breaking changes, new functionality, bug fix. And see [pessimistic versioning](http://joncairns.com/2013/07/using-the-pessimistic-version-constraint-operator-with-ruby-gem-versions/)
* [Include a license in your repo and in your gemspec](https://github.com/bf4/gemproject/issues/1)
