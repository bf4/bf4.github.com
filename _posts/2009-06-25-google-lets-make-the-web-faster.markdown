From building data centers in different parts of the world to designing highly efficient user interfaces, we at Google always strive to make our services faster. We focus on speed as a key requirement in product and infrastructure development, because our [research](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html) indicates that people prefer faster, more responsive apps. Over the years, through continuous experimentation, we've identified some performance best practices that we'd like to share with the web community on [code.google.com/speed](http://code.google.com/speed), a new site for web developers, with tutorials, tips and performance tools.

We are excited to [discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/make-the-web-faster) what we've learned about web performance with the Internet community. However, to optimize the speed of web applications and make browsing the web as fast as turning the pages of a magazine, we need to work together as a community, to tackle some larger challenges that keep the web slow and prevent it from delivering its full potential:

>   * Many protocols that power the Internet and the web were developed when broadband and rich interactive web apps were in their infancy. Networks have become much faster in the past 20 years, and by collaborating to update protocols such as HTML and TCP/IP we can create a better web experience for everyone. A great example of the community working together is [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5). With HTML5 features such as AppCache, developers are now able to write JavaScript-heavy web apps that run instantly and work and feel like desktop applications.

>   * In the last decade, we have seen close to a [100x improvement](http://www.webmonkey.com/print/blog/Google_Throws_Its_Weight_Behind_HTML_5) in JavaScript speed. Browser developers and the communities around them need to maintain this recent focus on performance improvement in order for the browser to become the platform of choice for more feature-rich and computationally-complex applications.
> 


	
>   * Many websites can become faster with little effort, and collective attention to performance can speed up the entire web. Tools such as Yahoo!'s [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) and our own recently launched [Page Speed](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/) help web developers create faster, more responsive web apps. As a community, we need to invest further in developing a new generation of tools for performance measurement, diagnostics, and optimization that work at the click of a button.

>   * While there are now more than 400 million broadband subscribers worldwide, broadband penetration is still relatively low in many areas of the world. Steps have been taken to bring the benefits of broadband to more people, such as the [FCC's decision](http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/11/vote-for-broadband-in-white-spaces.html) to open up the white spaces spectrum, for which the Internet community, including Google, was a strong champion. Bringing the benefits of cheap reliable broadband access around the world should be one of the primary goals of our industry.

Sounds good to me. I'm going to look into that [google speed page](http://code.google.com/speed/articles/) and the [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) andÂ  [Page Speed ](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/) applications.[
