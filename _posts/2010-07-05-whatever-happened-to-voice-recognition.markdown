In 2004, Mike Bliss [composed a poem  about voice recognition](http://www.theblisspages.com/cms.php?mbid=147). He then read it to voice recognition  software on his PC, and rewrote it as recognized.

> a poem by Mike Bliss

like a baby, it listens
it can't discriminate
it tries to understand
it reflects what it thinks you say
it gets it wrong... sometimes
sometimes it gets it right.
One day it will grow up,
like a baby, it has potential
will it go to work?
will it turn to crime?
you look at it indulgently.
you can't help loving it, can you?

> a poem by like myth

like a baby, it nuisance
it can't discriminate
it tries to oven
it reflects lot it things you say
it gets it run sometimes
sometimes it gets it right
won't day it will grow bop
Ninth a baby, it has provincial
will it both to look?
will it the two crime?
you move at it inevitably
you can't help loving it, cannot you?

There's only [one   teeny-tiny problem](http://robertfortner.posterous.com/the-unrecognized-death-of-speech-recognition) with this magical future world of computers we  control with our voices.

![Voice-recognition-accuracy-rate-over-time](http://www.codinghorror.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b0133f186ffd9970b-800wi)

It doesn't work.

Despite ridiculous, [order   of magnitude increases in computing power](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/12/moores-law-in-practical-terms.html) over the last decade, we  can't figure out how to get speech recognition accuracy above 80% --  when the baseline _human_ voice transcription accuracy rate is  anywhere from 96% to 98%!

But the software is so cheap... (I think we'd be better off teaching more people how to keyboard type and use Google without [http://lmgtfy.com?q=lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com?q=lmgtfy) )
