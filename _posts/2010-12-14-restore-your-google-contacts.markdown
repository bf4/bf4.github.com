> We’ve added a new feature to Google Contacts that allows you to revert your contact list and undo any mistakes made up to 30 days in the past. Let’s say you accidentally deleted a bunch of contacts or wiped the contact data from your Gmail account by mistake while syncing to another device. Visit Gmail’s Contacts section, select “Restore contacts” in the “More actions” menu, and choose the time you would like to revert to.

Thanks god! My complicated palm centro to vm outlook to google contacts with linkedin to addressbook got really messed up in late November, and a restore to 25 days earlier makes me happy.  I did export everything before the restore so I can put in the good changes since then.
