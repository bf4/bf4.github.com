> Pentago is a fun, challenging and multiple award winning strategy game for kids and adults, that is both simple and sophisticated at the same time. This is a two-player game in which the object is to create a row of five marbles, in any direction, before your opponent does, but with a twist. Each move consists of placing a marble and then twisting one of the four game blocks.

Children will gain spatial orientation, eye-hand coordination, logic and problem-solving abilities with this mind-twisting game. Each game is handcrafted with solid wood, aluminum and glass marbles.
