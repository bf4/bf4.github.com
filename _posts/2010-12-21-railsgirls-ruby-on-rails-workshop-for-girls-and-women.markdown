> WHY ARE YOU ORGANIZING THIS?
Internet was built by boys for boys. Sometimes, as a girl, it might be intimidating to ask questions or get started.

Kisko loves web, Rails - and girls. We like to help people learn new things.

WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?
Just basic knowledge of working with a computer. Zero programming or web development experience required - we'll walk through the development process together in small teams.

CAN MEN ATTEND?

Yes, but you need to be accompanied by an interested lady.

It's a shame there aren't more women in programming. Hopefully this will help develop the community.
