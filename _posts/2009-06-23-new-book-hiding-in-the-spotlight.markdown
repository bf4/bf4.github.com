A book by the father of a friend of mine, sounds interesting:

[Hiding in the Spotlight: A Musical Prodigy's Story of Survival, 1941-1946![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41x9sH%2Ba34L._SL500_AA240_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605980455?ie=UTF8&tag=hazujewi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1605980455)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hazujewi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1605980455)

Zhanna, a young Jewish girl from Ukraine, also happens to be a gifted piano prodigy and is giving concerts by the age of six. When disaster strikes her hometown and her family is condemned to exile and execution, Zhanna manages to escape the famed Nazi death march to Dorbitsky Yar and uses her rare musical gift to help her survive. Performing and giving concerts for the occupying German troops as they move throughout Europe, Zhanna keeps her true identity a secret until a young American soldier with ties to Julliard adopts her. Upon her emigration to America, Zhannaâ€™s gift flourishes and she becomes one of the first Jewish refugees to enter Juilliard.
