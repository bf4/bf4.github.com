> [![Esperanto and webm forever](/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1108.esperandm_37DFA219.png)](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html)The world’s ability to communicate with one another is a key factor in its rapid evolution and economic growth. The [Esperanto language ](http://www.webmproject.org/)was invented last century as a politically neutral language that would foster peace and international understanding. Since the launch, we’ve seen first-hand the benefits of a constructed language:

> 
> 
	
>   * A pure form of communication that is unsullied by cultural context;
> 
	
>   * Broad adoption by as many as 10,000 speakers
> 
	
>   * [Independent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantido) (yet mostly compatible) dialects that not only bring additional choice for speakers also foster healthy competition and innovation
> 

We expect even more communication between people in the coming year and are therefore focusing our investments in languages that are created based on constructed language principles. To that end, [we are changing the spoken and written language of this nation](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html) to make it consistent with the form of speech already supported by the [Language Creation Society](http://www.whatwg.org/). Specifically, we are supporting the [Esperanto](http://www.webmproject.org/) and[Klingon](http://theora.org/) languages, and will consider adding support for other high-quality constructed languages in the future. Though [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264) plays an important role in speech today, as our goal is to enable open innovation, its further use as a form of communication in this country will be prohibited and [our resources](http://www.youtube.com/) directed towards languages that are untainted by real-world usage.

These changes will occur in the next couple months but we are announcing them now to give citizens using other languages an opportunity to translate the [libraries of the world](http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/01/h-264-66-percent-web-video/) into Esperanto.

_Dankon, nedankinde!_

Whoa, Microsoft gets snarky, though they do have a point.  Does Chrome really need to drop h.264 support?  Though the analogy of adopting an unused language over a spoken one is clear, I don't get the technical comparison of Esperanto to WebM. (or h264 to English, for that matter).

And why is the flag's logo written in Latin?
