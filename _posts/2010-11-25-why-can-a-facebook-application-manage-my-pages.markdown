![Facebook App Spam](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/facebook_search_http_omg_13.png)

That's a problem because if the spammer gains access to your Page, it can be used to spread even more spam, and to collect your Page's insight data.

This seems like something that Facebook really should changeâ€¦ we're generally comfortable with the application controls that are in place. To develop an application, you need to validate your account with either a phone number or a credit card. And each user must approve the request for permissions.

But really, how many applications need to manage your pages?!?

There really should be an extra account validation in place to develop that particular feature.

Several of the applications shown above are now offline, but we're seeing new applications spawning to take their place. Facebook's antispam team has a busy day ahead.

Good question.
