He said that they tested various phrases on the [Highrise homepage](http://highrisehq.com/) for the call-to-action button. They originally had used various permutations of “Free Trial” and “Sign-up for Free Trial”. Then they tested the phrase:

“See Plans and Pricing”

This resulted in a **200% increase in sign-ups**. That’s right. 200%.

On reflection, when comparison shopping a service or site, I'm much more likely to continue investigating if they have a "Plans and Pricing" link that makes it easier to figure out how much it actually costs.  Some sites make me go through a signup or purchase process just to find the prices, and, those, I often bypass as not worth the effort.
