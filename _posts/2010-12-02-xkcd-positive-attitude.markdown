> [xkcd: Positive Attitude](http://xkcd.com/828/).


So true, and also in social interactions. Â Happy, friendly people are more approachable than angry, aggressive people.

I try to remind myself when I'm mad at or frustrated with someone not to put him or her on the defensive-- to keep the discussion constructive-- else the focus will shift from the subject of the conversation to a feeling of attack.
