**What kind of computer software have you used?**

"Computers? Are those the black boxes that sit on the floor next to the desks? My boss has one of those. He uses it. I don't have one. He just gives me my schedule and I follow it." - _Greg Szymanski, director of human resources, Geonerco Management, Inc_

via [43 weird things said in job interviews - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/worklife/07/22/cb.you.said.what.interview/index.html?eref=rss_latest).

Good advice for anyone on what NOT to say.
