![Inception: Shared Dreaming](/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/inception13-300x200.jpg)

Whatever you think of the possibility of designing and controlling shared dreams, there's one huge plot problem that I haven't heard discussed.  Much of the drama centered around the idea of living for "years" in a dream.  So, I ask: where was the anesthesiologist to put the down and take them back?!

I mean, all this nonsense about "the kick"... couldn't an anesthesiologist just wake them up? (And shouldn't there be one there anyways?)
