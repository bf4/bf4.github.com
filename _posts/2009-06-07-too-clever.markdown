I thought I'd be clever and create a google doc to use as a kind of wiki invite evite. I created it, sent myself a link, and forwarded out the link. Not sure what went wrong, but I think it didn't let people already logged into gmail into the page.  Plus, my list of invited 'collaborators' kept decreasing. I will permanently strike that idea and go back to evite for now.  It works fine for coordinating what people should bring to a meal or party, and everyone is already comfortable with it.
