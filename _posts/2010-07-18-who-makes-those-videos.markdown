> Sometimes bad can be good. YouTube came out with a new video editor and [got the brilliant Yeshmin Blechin to explain it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VbMLOcbK74).

Introduced me to some great publicity I missed. Very entertaining to watch the videos.

And don't miss the successful [Old Spice videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/oldspice?feature=chclk), if you haven't seen them already.
