I cam home today to find my macbook off.  That's odd. I open the console to see what was happening.

```

It looks like betwen 7am and 2pm today I was subject to an ssh brute force attack from China.
I'm not exactly sure how that caused a kernel panic, but I'm pretty sure my computer is fine.

And I feel somewhat foolish for leaving port 22 on my router forwarding to my machine.
Yes, it's useful for pairing over tmux, but I don't need to always be forwarding it.
So, I closed that, and thought I'd post this experience and some logs
in case it helps anyone figure out what was going on, ways to fix it, and perhaps a few interesting bits of data
to look at such as ips, username attempts, and connection frequency.

An interesting thing that I learned is that [OSX Yosemite now handles ssh connections
with launchd, rather than sshd](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/releasenotes.html).

And yes, I'm running little snitch.

## Details

I'm pretty sure there's nothing private in here, but if you think there is, please email me 'bf' at this domain.
