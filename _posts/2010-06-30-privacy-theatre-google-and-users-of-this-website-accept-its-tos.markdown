The term, inspired by Bruce Schneier’s “security theater” description of US airport security, may have been introduced by Rohit Khare in December 2009 [on TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/27/privacy-theater/), where he described how “social networks only pretend to protect your privacy.” These are real issues, and I wholeheartedly agree that long privacy policies and generally consumer-directed fine-print are all theater.

I like this idea.  He then discusses_ _what he calls _advocacy theatre_:


> I want to focus on a related problem that I’ll call privacy _advocacy_ theater. This is a problem that my friends and colleagues are guilty of, and I’m sure I’m guilty of it at times, too. Privacy Advocacy Theater is the act of extreme criticism for an accidental data breach rather than a systemic privacy design flaw. Example: if you’re up in arms over the Google Street View privacy “fiasco” of the last few days, you’re guilty of Privacy Advocacy Theater. (If you’re generally worried about Google Street View, that’s a different problem, there are real concerns there, but I’m only talking about the collection of wifi network payload data Google performed by mistake.)


On a technical level, Ben follows up:

Kim Cameron [responded](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=1102), and he is right to point out that my argument, in the Google case, missed an important issue.

Kim thinks the network identifiers are inherently more problematic than the payload, because they last for quite a bit of time, while payload data, collected for a few randomly chosen milliseconds, are quite ephemeral and unlikely to be problematic.

> Kim’s right on both points. Discussion of device identifiers, which I missed in my first post, is necessary, because the data collection, in this case, was intentional, and apparently _was not disclosed_, as documented in[EPIC’s letter to the FCC](http://epic.org/2010/05/epic-urges-federal-communicati-1.html). If Google is collecting public wifi data, they should _at least_ disclose it. In their [blog post on this topic](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/wifi-data-collection-update.html), Google does not clarify that issue.

I enjoyed the way of thinking here in addition to the issues discussed.
