Interesting new browser plugin for Firefox or Internet Explorer with realtime link and code scanning.  May be a strong competitor for [McAfee SiteAdvisor](http://www.siteadvisor.com/).

SecureBrowsing plugin by Finjan:


> **Gives you the highest rate of malicious code detection: **

> 
> 
	
>   * _Scans_ the current form of a page as it available on the Web now, in real-time.
> 
	
>   * _Detects_ malicious content based on code analysis, rather than using signatures like anti-virus products.
> 
	
>   * _Provides_ the most accurate page safety rating based on the actual page content, rather than database lookup of web address like URL filtering products.
> 

**Ensuring your privacy:**

> 
> 
	
>   * Doesn’t track each and every URL you visit.
> 
	
>   * Doesn’t require your identification details.
> 
	
>   * Doesn’t install additional programs or change settings of your desktop.
