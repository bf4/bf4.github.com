I've moved this blog to a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) one 
based on [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/)'s [left theme](https://github.com/holman/left).  
This is hosted on [Github's Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

I also created a new favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png via this easy-to-use gist.
I did have to update my Imagemagick to get it to work.

Thanks to [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp), a copy of my uploads directory,
and some commandline skills for getting me off Wordpress.
