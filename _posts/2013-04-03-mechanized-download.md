I'm a subscriber of [Avdi Grimm's screencast series, RubyTapas](rubytapas.com). Avdi helpfully provides a podcast feed I can regularly download, but no mechanism for downloading each episode's associated files.  So, I wrote a [ruby script to download the non-video files](https://gist.github.com/bf4/5303227).

You'll note I already wrote a script [to download Destroy All Software videos](https://gist.github.com/bf4/4070991), though Gary Bernhardt has discontinued the service.
