The market is such a racket.  I recently read Michael Lewis' [Liar's Poker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039333869X?ie=UTF8&tag=hazujewi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=039333869X)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hazujewi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=039333869X)
and I am more convinced than ever. I don't know how someone can watch these markets and think prices are perfectly set.  It's mostly herd behavior and algorithms.
