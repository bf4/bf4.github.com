I recently decided to [distribute MetricFu as a cryptographically signed gem](https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu/commit/ed2f96d8ce514ea0c647736d67f6ec3e863d0bb1), using the RubyGems gemspec.

I found it really hard to find documentation, so I'm sharing what I learned.


## Signing and building your gem

1) Create self-signed gem cert

```sh
cd ~/.ssh
gem cert --build your@email.com
chmod 600 gem-p*
```

- use the email address you specify in your gemspecs

2) Configure gemspec with cert

- Add cert public key to your repository

```sh
cd /path/to/your/gem
mkdir certs
cp ~/.ssh/gem-public_cert.pem certs/yourhandle.pem
git add certs/yourhandle.pem
```

I named the cert in metric_fu bf4.pem since that is my github username


- Add cert paths to your gemspec

```ruby
 s.cert_chain  = ['certs/yourhandle.pem']
 s.signing_key = File.expand_path("~/.ssh/gem-private_key.pem") if $0 =~ /gem\z/
```

3) Add your own cert to your approved list, just like anyone else

```sh
gem cert --add certs/bf4.pem
```

4) Build gem and test that you can install it

```sh
gem build metric_fu.gemspec
gem install metric_fu-4.5.1.gem -P HighSecurity
```

## Example instructions for others to install

> MetricFu is cryptographically signed. To be sure the gem you install hasn't been tampered with:

> Add my public key (if you haven't already) as a trusted certificate 
> gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/metricfu/metric_fu/master/certs/bf4.pem)
> gem install metric_fu -P HighSecurity
> This may cause installation to fail if non-signed dependent gems are also being installed.
